# OrderedArrayList

Some stuff we went over in the breakout room:
1. What we'd do and how to work with this file.
2. Default constructor takes no parameters.
3. All we need to do when overwriting the methods is establish the conditions for the IllegalArgumentException,
throw the exception, and call the old method.
4. We do not need to rewrite any old methods.
